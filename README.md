## Usage

To use this plugin, add [`easy_container`](https://pub.dev/packages/easy_container) as a dependency in your pubspec.yaml file.

```yaml
  dependencies:
    flutter:
      sdk: flutter
    easy_container:
```

First and foremost, import the widget.
```dart
import 'package:easy_container/easy_container.dart';
```

You can now add an [`EasyContainer`](https://github.com/rithik-dev/easy_container/blob/master/lib/easy_container.dart) widget to your widget tree and pass the child as the only required parameter to get started.
This widget will create a route between the source and the destination LatLng's provided.
```dart
EasyContainer(
    child: Text("Hello World"),
),
```

Sample Usage
```dart
```

See the [`example`](https://github.com/rithik-dev/easy_container/blob/master/example) directory for a complete sample app.
